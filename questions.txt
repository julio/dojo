                        The Retrospective is team-driven, but most often facilitated by the Scrum Master. Team members should decide together how the meetings will be run and how decisions will be made about improvements. An atmosphere of honesty and trust is needed for every member to feel comfortable sharing their thoughts.
                        Retrospectives are arguably the most important ceremonies, as they are the best opportunity the teams have for improving all aspects of how they operate.',

          explanation: 'A Development Team\'s velocity is a historical record of the amount of work completed in previous Sprints. This can help forecast how much work the team can get done per Sprint.
                        Given a team\'s known velocity for its last several Sprints, a Release Plan represents how much scope that team intends to deliver by a given deadline. Alternatively, the forecast can show how long it will take to get a certain amount of the Product Backlog converted into working software. This is data vs. feature target planning.',
