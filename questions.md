# Level 1 - Bronze

## Retrospectives

### Explanation

Retrospectives are inspect and adapt sessions for the team itself. The team reflects on how the closing Sprint went and decides what changes they want to make in the next Sprint.

The Retrospective is team-driven, but most often facilitated by the Scrum Master. Team members should decide together how the meetings will be run and how decisions will be made about improvements. An atmosphere of honesty and trust is needed for every member to feel comfortable sharing their thoughts.

Retrospectives are arguably the most important ceremonies, as they are the best opportunity the teams have for improving all aspects of how they operate.

**Answers**

- 1: We do not use Retrospectives
- 2: We meet at the end of most sprints to discuss what went well or poorly
- 3: We have action items assigned to owners
- 4: We track and confirm that identified topics get addressed and eliminated

**Hints**

- We retrospect frequently
- We have action items for how to work better
- We track the impact of our improvements
- We retrospect with the teams we collaborate with

## Product Owner

### Explanation

Product Owners are the Development Team’s customer. Product Owners are responsible for having a vision of what he or she wishes to build, and conveying that vision to the Scrum Team. The Product Owner is accountable for the Product Backlog, which is an ordered list of features for the product.

The Product Owner is commonly a lead user of the system, a Product Manager, a Product Marketing Manager, or someone with a solid understanding of users, the marketplace, the competition and represents the product to the customer.

**Answers**

- 1: We do not have a dedicated ProductOwner
- 2: Our Product Owner is really a project manager or a proxy for the real owner
- 3: Our Product Owner acts as the trueProduct Manager
- 4: Our Product Owner truly owns the products we work on, being responsible for customers' and business success

**Hints**

- The PO represents the business
- The PO has a vision for the product
- The PO maximizes business value
- The PO writes stories in a way that allows the team to contribute to the "what"

## Working Software

### Explanation

Working software is the standard for successful completion of a Sprint. Scrum calls the software delivered at the end of a Sprint an Increment of working software.

Teams show their Increment and get feedback at the end of each Sprint on the functionality created. Working software is key to lightweight planning, iterating on a product feature, and getting great final outcomes.

Working software at the end of each Sprint saves time by ensuring the Product Owner could ship the software at any time should he or she choose. It guarantees the team is building what customers really want, even if customers change their mind. This is the essence of being agile.',

**Answers**

- 1: We make no attempt at having deployable software at least at the end of each sprint
- 2: It is common to end the sprint with nothing that is deployable and can be delivered to customers
- 3: We routinely have working and deployable software at least each sprint
- 4: Every single sprint we have working software we put in the hands of users to gather feedback and steer the product

**Hints**

- We favor working software over comprehensive documentation
- We deliver working software each sprint
- We deliver product increments each sprint
- We learn and adapt from how the software we deliver is being used

## Sprints

### Explanation

Sprints, or iterations, are regularly occurring time-boxes occurring on a fixed cadence. The team can demonstrate working software at the end of each Sprint. Sprints contain all the work and other ceremonies of Scrum.

Sprints longer than a month accumulate too much risk. Sprints less than a week are often too short to deliver customer value. Two-week Sprints are the sweet spot that works for most teams at the company.',

**Answers**

- 1: We do not consistently have fixed-length iterations
- 2: We work in short fixed-length sprints
- 3: We work in two-week sprints that we consider deadlines
- 4: We start and finish our sprints in alignment with other teams

**Hints**

- We work in time-boxed iterations
- We work in one or two week iterations
- We treat each end of sprint as a soft deadline
- We align our start and end of sprints with the teams we have dependencies on

# Level: 2 - Silver

## Self-Organizing Team

### Explanation

A team that is cross-functional and self-organizing will be able to deliver business value more quickly than a team that must wait for aspects of their products to be done by somebody else.

A self-organizing team has all the competencies it needs to deliver working software; team members actively help each other learn and improve in new areas.',

**Answers**

- 1: We are told how and who should do what
- 2: We estimate our work as a team
- 3: We have all the skills and the confidence to accomplish all the work we take on
- 4: Work in progress is very limited and no work gets started without other end-to-end work being completed

**Hints**

- We are responsible for managing our work
- We estimate the size and complexity of our work
- We have all the skills needed to deliver working software
- We work on the same projects together

## Backlog

### Explanation

The Product Backlog in Scrum is the single source of truth for what changes will occur in the product. It is a list of ordered changes to occur in the software being created. It contains short descriptions of all functionality desired in the product. It is not necessary to have a lengthy Product Backlog to get started working on creating software.

Often, a Scrum Team creates an initial Product Backlog by writing down everything they can think of for Backlog ordering. This Product Backlog is almost always enough for a first Sprint.

The Scrum Product Backlog is then allowed to grow and change as more is learned about the product and its customers. A healthy Product Backlog forecasts work for about the next 3 Sprints.',

**Answers**

- 1: We do not have a single, centralized backlog
- 2: The team works from a single backlog
- 3: The items in the backlog are prioritized according to their business or customer value
- 4: Our backlog is clean, groomed, and ready for execution for at least a few sprints

**Hints**

- Our Product Backlog is ordered by value
- Our Product Backlog is forecast several sprints ahead
- Our Product Backlog is a good representation of the products we are building
- Our Product Backlog maps to a burn-down or a build-up progress chart

## Scrum Master

### Explanation

The Scrum Master is responsible for making sure a Scrum Team thrives by living the values and principles of agile.

The Scrum Master coaches the team to higher levels of performance, helping the team do the best work it possibly can.

The Scrum Master often facilitates meetings, such as the Sprint Retrospective, and Daily Scrum (or stand up) meeting. Good Scrum Masters are tireless advocates for their teams, blocking outside interference and removing impediments to the team’s success, allowing the team to focus throughout the Sprint.',

**Answers**

- 1: We do not have anyone we could consider a scrum master
- 2: We have a dedicated scrum master
- 3: Our scrum master acts as a coach, facilitator, impediment remover and change agent
- 4: Everyone in our team could be the ideal scrum master

**Hints**

- The SM acts as a coach
- The SM acts as a facilitator
- The SM acts as a impediment remover
- The SM acts as a change agent

## Automated Build

### Explanation

Continuous Integration and Deployment (CICD) is the practice of automatically building, testing, and even deploying through an automated system. Each build results in an integrated software product, regardless of whether it is potentially valuable to ship.

CICD steps are automated and repeatable, requiring no direct human intervention, and can be performed at any time. A healthy CICD pipeline should take a reasonable amount of time to complete, not blocking commits as it runs. Tests are run with each build, and if they fail, the build is considered broken. When the CICD build is broken, it is fixed immediately before new functionality is added.',


**Answers**

- 1: Building our software involves several undocumented manual steps
- 2: The steps to build the software are well documented
- 3: Running a single script is all that needs to be done
- 4: Anyone no matter how new to the team can build the software by running a script or pushing a button

**Hints**

- The software is built via an automated process, even if locally
- The software is built each time a commit or check-in occurs
- The software is built in a short and manageable amount of time
- The software is built in an easy and repeatable way does not require specialized skills

# Level 3 - Platinum

## Cross Team Collaboration

### Explanation

Collaboration simply means to work jointly rather than independently to accomplish a task.

For teams to be successful, collaboration must occur between Product Owners planning and coordinating their Product Backlogs. Further, technologists from interdependent teams must work together to overcome integration obstacles.',

**Answers**

- 1: We are routinely blocked by other teams and do not have a clear idea when we will be unblocked
- 2: We are routinely blocked by other teams and can work around it as we know when we will be unblocked
- 3: We collaborate with teams we depend on to minimize surprises and delays
- 4: We build our functionality in tight collaboration with the teams we are coupled with

**Hints**

- Our team does not surprise other teams with ad-hoc work requests
- Our team share a combined definition of done with other teams
- Our team does not hesitate attending other teams' ceremonies to improve learning and collaboration
- Our team prefers to over-communicate when other teams have any dependency on ours

## User Stories

### Explanation

User Stories are a tool used in agile environments. They act as lightweight requirements that are easily understood by stakeholders and development team members. The lightweight nature of User Stories helps shift the focus from writing about requirements to talking about them.

All agile User Stories include a written sentence or two and, more importantly, a series of conversations about the desired functionality.

These items tell a story, about how the user is to interact with the system. User Stories are not the sole responsibility of the Product Owner, but the Product Owner is accountable for ordering them in the Product Backlog.',

**Answers**

- 1: We capture our work in an actionable format
- 2: The purpose for each User Story is well understood by the team
- 3: Most of our User Stories have actionable and verifiable acceptance criteria
- 4: The majority of our User Story tells a story about how the user would interact with our product

**Hints**

- Most of our User Stories communicate value to our users
- Most of our User Stories tell a story on how a user will interact with our product
- Most of our User Stories fit in a single sprint, from start to done
- Most of our User Stories have automatable acceptance criteria

## Sprint Goals

### Explanation

A Sprint Goal summarizes the desired outcome of an iteration. It provides a shared objective, and it states why it\'s worthwhile undertaking the Sprint. Each Sprint should have one Sprint Goal for the team to share.

Sample Sprint Goals include

  - Create the correct user interaction for the registration feature
  - Provide the missing reporting functionality

This helps with focus and clear understanding of Sprint outcomes.

**Answers**

- 1: We do not have specific and distinct business goals for each sprint
- 2: We have some idea for how the stories we are working on relate to each other
- 3: On most sprints we identify a set of goals that we are trying to get to by the end of the sprint
- 4: Each sprint has a very specific focus that all the stories align with and the whole team is working towards

**Hints**

- Each sprint has a goal to that the Product Owner and team agree to accomplish during the sprint
- Each sprint has a goal to align team members to a common purpose
- Each sprint has a goal to encourage team focus
- Each sprint has a goal to encourage the team to self-organize

## Design Simplicity

### Explanation

Agile teams are under pressure to deliver working, tested code at the end of each Sprint. They are also available to their customers for potentially radical requirements changes at any point outside the boundary of a Sprint. This means the Sprint Goal from one Sprint to the next may be radically different.

Thus, the design of code must allow it to change direction quickly. Agile teams place enormous value on the extensibility of their code: the extent to which they can easily maintain and extend it.

Code is written to be maintainable and understandable by the next person who sees it. Refactoring to keep code extensible and code design simple are key components to extensibility. Commonly understood patterns and implementation designs are key to simplicity.',

**Answers**

- 1: We often over-engineer our solutions
- 2: We are sometimes distracted by what-if scenarios that we want to plan for
- 3: We design our solutions for the story at hand, without anticipating what future stories and sprints might need
- 4: Thanks to techniques such as TDD, BDD, Pair Programming, Clear Acceptance Criteria, Definition of Done; a story is done when it does what is supposed to do, an no more

**Hints**

- The team does not create abstractions before they are needed
- The team uses design and architecture patterns to improve efficiency
- The team strives to express our code as simply as possible
- The team refactors code as we create new features and fix bugs

# Level 4 - Diamond

## Team Transparency

### Explanation

Openness, transparency, and visibility are critical to successful Scrum adoption. A Scrum Team’s transparency makes everything going on within the project visible to any stakeholders, so they can adjust their plans according to the reality of what is happening in the Scrum Team.

For Scrum to be successful, there is no hidden work. Everyone knows what is currently being worked on, what will likely be worked on next, what will be delivered by the team by the end of each Sprint.',

**Answers**

- 1: We have our backlog available to anyone who wants to see
- 2: We have a public slack room anyone can reach to ask questions, though we use a private one for ourselves
- 3: We only have public slack rooms that anyone can join if they want to
- 4: We have public dashboards with our metrics, we have stand-ups out in the open, we invite other teams to our demos and ceremonies

**Hints**

- We have information radiators with visible metrics on how we are doing
- We encourage members from other teams and our own managers to attend our ceremonies
- We have open repos for anyone outside our team to contribute to
- We frequently participate in demo fests

## Customer Value

# Explanation

Whether a customer is internal or external, there is invariably at least one customer for every Scrum Team. The relationship between the cost of work performed and the needs of the customer determines the value of work performed.

The value of work performed can and should be estimated or measured in a way that can be used to calculate the Return on Investment of any work the team undertakes.

Any work undertaken in a Sprint should clearly map to the direct benefit it provides the customer, and the customer is often consulted by the Product Owner to ensure the most valuable work is being done next.',

**Answers**

- 1: We do not always see how what we do aligns with customer value
- 2: We build functionality for other teams and expect it to be part of a more valuable story
- 3: We are confident that we are building exactly what customers say they want
- 4: We use techniques such as Design Thinking to ensure we build what the customers really need, even they haven't expressed it

**Hints**

- With the Product Owner, we ensure that our users could directly benefit from the work we do each sprint
- With the Product Owner, we ensure that the team is focused on work with the highest possible business value
- With the Product Owner, we ensure that the impact we have each sprint is instrumented and its value maximized
- With the Product Owner, we ensure that we use techniques such as Design Thinking to maximize for customer satisfaction

## Release Planning

### Explanation

A Development Team's velocity is a historical record of the amount of work completed in previous Sprints. This can help forecast how much work the team can get done per Sprint.

Given a team's known velocity for its last several Sprints, a Release Plan represents how much scope that team intends to deliver by a given deadline. Alternatively, the forecast can show how long it will take to get a certain amount of the Product Backlog converted into working software. This is data vs. feature target planning.',

**Answers**

- 1: We build functionality for the sprint and do not have a longer term vision for where we are going
- 2: We know where the product should be this month
- 3: We have a long term vision for the product that is well articulated by the Product Owner
- 4: We track progress every sprint and can easily make realistic adjustments

**Hints**

- Our Product Owner knows when our next release will likely be delivered and what the scope is likely to be
- Our Product Owner has a public release plan
- Our Product Owner understands that we can commit to a date or to scope, but not both
- Our Product Owner is familiar with the cone of uncertainty and understands that we know more as time progresses

## Test Focus

## Explanation

Test Focus ensures that everyone on the team has quality and automation in mind, and this is not the responsibility of just a person or two.',

**Answers**

- 1: Our Continuous Integration system is not yet set up
- 2: Our Continuous Integration system runs with every commits which not necessarily invalidates builds
- 3: Our Continuous Integration system ensures we have high test coverage
- 4: Our Continuous Integration system accounts performance, integration, i18n, compatibility

**Hints**

- Commits include accompanying automated tests
- Commits trigger a Continuous Integration job that validates our functionality
- Commits require very little human intervention to be validated
- Commits are validated in terms of performance, security, i18n, and other advanced considerations
